# Rain detector system OLED

This is a simple rain detector project. I use an Arduino Nano clone combined with the popular rain sensor (sensor board + electronic module). An OLED display shows the status. In case of rain detection, the microcontroller activates the LED and buzzer and displays a rain cloud on the screen. Simple. Hope you like it.
